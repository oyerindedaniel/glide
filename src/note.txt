Further Improvements (If Needed)
Exponential Backoff – Add a delay between retries to avoid overwhelming the system.
Detailed Metrics – Track how many pages succeeded/failed and retries performed for better monitoring.
Dynamic Concurrency – Increase MAX_CONCURRENT_FILES dynamically based on system load.

Resulting this.pageRanges
three placeholders stacked vertically, each 1500px tall. After running this code, this.pageRanges might look like:

[
  { pageId: "file1_1", start: 0, end: 1500 },
  { pageId: "file1_2", start: 1500, end: 3000 },
  { pageId: "file1_3", start: 3000, end: 4500 }
]
